Reggie provides Vera a public key\n  * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\n  * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\n  * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\n\n  * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\n  * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\n  * @dev the output is computationally indistinguishable to her from a uniform\n  * @dev random sample from the output space.\n\n  * @dev The purpose of this contract is to perform that verification.\n  * ****************************************************************************\n  * @dev DESIGN NOTES\n\n  * @dev The VRF algorithm verified here satisfies the full uniqueness, full\n  * @dev collision resistance, and full pseudo-randomness security properties.\n  * @dev See \"SECURITY PROPERTIES\" below, and\n  * @dev https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-3\n\n  * @dev An elliptic curve point is generally represented in the solidity code\n  * @dev as a uint256[2], corresponding to its affine coordinates in\n  * @dev GF(FIELD_SIZE).\n\n  * @dev For the sake of efficiency, this implementation deviates from the spec\n  * @dev in some minor ways:\n\n  * @dev - Keccak hash rather than the SHA256 hash recommended in\n  * @dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5\n  * @dev   Keccak costs much less gas on the EVM, and provides similar security.\n\n  * @dev - Secp256k1 curve instead of the P-256 or ED25519 curves recommended in\n  * @dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.5\n  * @dev   For curve-point multiplication, it's much cheaper to abuse ECRECOVER\n\n  * @dev - hashToCurve recursively hashes until it finds a curve x-ordinate. On\n  * @dev   the EVM, this is slightly more efficient than the recommendation in\n  * @dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.1.1\n  * @dev   step 5, to concatenate with a nonce then hash, and rehash with the\n  * @dev   nonce updated until a valid x-ordinate is found.\n\n  * @dev - hashToCurve does not include a cipher version string or the byte 0x1\n  * @dev   in the hash message, as recommended in step 5.B of the draft\n  * @dev   standard. They are unnecessary here because no variation in the\n  * @dev   cipher suite is allowed.\n\n  * @dev - Similarly, the hash input in scalarFromCurvePoints does not include a\n  * @dev   commitment to the cipher suite, either, which differs from step 2 of\n  * @dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.4.3\n  * @dev   . Also, the hash input is the concatenation of the uncompressed\n  * @dev   points, not the compressed points as recommended in step 3.\n\n  * @dev - In the calculation of the challenge value \"c\", the \"u\" value (i.e.\n  * @dev   the value computed by Reggie as the nonce times the secp256k1\n  * @dev   generator point, see steps 5 and 7 of\n  * @dev   https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.3\n  * @dev   ) is replaced by its ethereum address, i.e. the lower 160 bits of the\n  * @dev   keccak hash of the original u. This is because we only verify the\n  * @dev   calculation of u up to its address, by abusing ECRECOVER.\n  * ****************************************************************************\n  * @dev   SECURITY PROPERTIES\n\n  * @dev Here are the security properties for this VRF:\n\n  * @dev Full uniqueness: For any seed and valid VRF public key, there is\n  * @dev   exactly one VRF output which can be proved to come from that seed, in\n  * @dev   the sense that the proof will pass verifyVRFProof.\n\n  * @dev Full collision resistance: It's cryptographically infeasible to find\n  * @dev   two seeds with same VRF output from a fixed, valid VRF key\n\n  * @dev Full pseudorandomness: Absent the proofs that the VRF outputs are\n  * @dev   derived from a given seed, the outputs are computationally\n  * @dev   indistinguishable from randomness.\n\n  * @dev https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/099.pdf, Appendix B contains the proofs\n  * @dev for these properties.\n\n  * @dev For secp256k1, the key validation described in section\n  * @dev https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-05#section-5.6\n  * @dev is unnecessary, because secp256k1 has cofactor 1, and the\n  * @dev representation of the public key used here (affine x- and y-ordinates\n  * @dev of the secp256k1 point on the standard y^2=x^3+7 curve) cannot refer to\n  * @dev the point at infinity.\n  * ****************************************************************************\n  * @dev OTHER SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n  *\n  * @dev The seed input to the VRF could in principle force an arbitrary amount\n  * @dev of work in hashToCurve, by requiring extra rounds of hashing and\n  * @dev checking whether that's yielded the x ordinate of a secp256k1 point.\n  * @dev However, under the Random Oracle Model the probability of choosing a\n  * @dev point which forces n extra rounds in hashToCurve is 2⁻ⁿ. The base cost\n  * @dev for calling hashToCurve is about 25,000 gas, and each round of checking\n  * @dev for a valid x ordinate costs about 15,555 gas, so to find a seed for\n  * @dev which hashToCurve would cost more than 2,017,000 gas, one would have to\n  * @dev try, in expectation, about 2¹²⁸ seeds, which is infeasible for any\n  * @dev foreseeable computational resources.
